The HTML and CSS are ready but I need to implement JavaScript code to make the game work.
</p>

<h3>How does this game works?</h3>

<ol>
<li>The computer generates a secret random number;</li>
<li>You need to guess the number by typing it in a specific entry;</li>
<li>You have 20 attempts. There is a counter showing your current score and there is also a message box showing the result or giving you some hints.</li>
<li>You can restart the game at any time just clicking the "Again!" button. You can check your high score in the HighScore field.</li>
</ol>
